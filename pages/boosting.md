## ❯ Boosting

Nanogram allows users to promote their favorite creators to help them reach a larger audience and fan base. When you boosts someone’s post, their post will be shared to your page and following, sent back to the top of the hashtags that the creator used in their post, and also back to the top for all users who follow them.

Think of it like a supercharged share. Not only did you share the creator’s post to your own profile, but you also refreshed it across the entire platform!
