Boosting on Nanogram allows other users to promote their favorite creators to help them reach a larger audience and fan base. When you boosts someone’s post, their post will be shared to your page, sent back to the top of the feed on hashtags the creator used in their post, and also to the top of the feeds of all users who follow the creator.  Think of it like a supercharged share! Not only did you share the creator’s post to your own profile, but you also refreshed it across the entire platform.
